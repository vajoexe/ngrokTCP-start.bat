# ngrokTCP-start.bat
This is the script I used to use for my Minecraft server's IP so my friends could join. Windows only.
Includes comments explaining everything in the script.
Script works as of now (7/27/2025) with the latest ngrok version/API.
Feel free to use and share. If you want to distribute this script yourself, you need to credit me. Thanks.
